<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>ChronoVox</strong> application.
    The developers of ChronoVox value and respect users’ privacy.
    Below is a detailed explanation of how information is handled within the application.
</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>
    The ChronoVox application does not collect or store any user data.
    No personal information such as names, surnames, email addresses,
    contact details, location data, or any other personal information is collected or stored.
</p>
<p>
    The application also does not collect non-personal information, such as usage statistics
    or device information including device model, operating system, or internet service provider.
</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>
    ChronoVox does not share any information with third parties.
    All information generated within the application is used exclusively for its internal
    functionality and is not shared with any external entity.
</p>

<h2>Use of Permissions</h2>
<p>
    ChronoVox may request the following permissions (depending on the Android version in use)
    strictly for operational purposes.
    These permissions are not used for any other purpose.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Foreground Services and Audio Playback:</strong><br>
        Used to ensure that the timer continues functioning correctly even when
        the application is not in the foreground or when the device is locked.
        These permissions allow the use of Text-to-Speech and user-configured
        alert sounds when the timer finishes.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Notifications:</strong><br>
        Used to display the timer status in the notification bar and to alert the user
        when the timer finishes.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Storage:</strong><br>
        Access is requested solely to allow users to save statistic screenshots,
        export results, and save or load name lists locally on their device.
        The application does not access, transmit, or synchronize these files
        with external servers or cloud services.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Run at Startup:</strong><br>
        Used exclusively to restore active timers or alerts configured by the user
        prior to a device restart.
        The application does not run in the background without prior user action.
    </li>

    <li>
        <strong>Vibration:</strong><br>
        Used to provide alerts and confirmations during app usage.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    The use of these permissions does not involve the collection, storage,
    or transmission of user data.
</p>

<h2>Data Deletion</h2>
<p>
    Since ChronoVox does not collect or store personal data and does not use
    external servers, there is no user information to delete.
</p>

<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time.
    Users will be informed of any changes through an application update
    or other appropriate means.
</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
